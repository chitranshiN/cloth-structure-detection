# cloth-structure-detection
The main purpose of the work presented is to apply the concepts of deep learning algorithm namely, Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN ) in image classification.

The model will be trained to classify the image in 10 different classes (classes represent type of cloth structure).
	
Classes are as follows:
        - Jacket, Shirt, T-Shirt, Saree, Shorts, Pants, One Piece, Gown and   Kurta

To interact with the Trained Model, we have provided the user with option to give inputs for prediction in form of images :
First method: User can browse image from their local device.
Second method: User can directly upload image using their Webcam

OUTPUT : Userâ€™s provided image will be labelled according to the predicted class of cloth structure. For the same detected class, links of different websites directing to the similar cloth structure cloths will be provided.
